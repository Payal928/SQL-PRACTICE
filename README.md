# SQL-PRACTICE
This repository contains my SQL practice work including theoretical concepts and practical queries. It covers SQL fundamentals (DDL, DML, DQL), key constructs like LIMIT, OFFSET, GROUP BY, HAVING, and Common Table Expressions (CTE). It also includes hands-on query solving using the Sakila database for real-world understanding.
